# _LEGO Universe News!_ Patcher #

[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)

This is a "patcher" (actually a news widget) designed for the [_LEGO Universe News!_ Forums](http://legouniversenews.forummotion.com/).
It is designed to imitate one of the later patchers from the now-closed MMOG [LEGO® Universe](http://universe.lego.com/en-us/default.aspx),
and explains why it is called a patcher.

The news widget contains an HTML5 YouTube embed player, links to the LUNF rules, FAQ, and Staff Members pages, in addition to a news feed.
More details for the embed player can be found in [`js/script.js`](js/script.js).
The news feed pulls from [_LEGO Universe News!_](http://legouniversenews.wordpress.com/) using the FeedEk jQuery RSS/ATOM Feed Plugin.
