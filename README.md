# LEGO Universe News! Forums Patcher #

This is a "patcher" for the [LEGO Universe News! Forums](http://legouniversenews.forummotion.com/).
This "patcher" is actually a newswidget created completely by rioforce.
It was designed to imitate one of the many patchers from the now-closed MMOG [LEGO® Universe](http://universe.lego.com/en-us/default.aspx),
and explains why it is called a patcher.

The newswidget contains a YouTube video, links to the LUNF rules, FAQ, and Staff Memebers, in addtion to a news feed.
The HTML5 YouTube embed player can be changed by updating the `iframe` link in [`js/script.js`](js/script.js).
The news feed pulls news from [LEGO Universe News!](http://legouniversenews.wordpress.com/) using the services from [http://feed.mikle.com](http://feed.mikle.com/)
