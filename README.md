LEGO Universe News! Forums Patcher
==================================

This is a "patcher" for the [LEGO Universe News! Forums](http://legouniversenews.forummotion.com/). 
This "patcher" is actually a newswidget created completely by [@rioforce](https://github.com/rioforce).
It was designed to imitate one of the many patchers from the now-closed MMOG [_LEGOÂ® Universe_](http://universe.lego.com/en-us/default.aspx), 
and explains why it is called a patcher.

The newswidget contains a YouTube video, links to the LUNF rules, FAQ, and Staff Memebers, in addtion to a news feed. 
The HTML5 YouTube embed player can be changed by updating the `iframe` link in [`pages/video.html`](pages/video.html). 
The news feed pulls news from [LEGO Universe News!](http://legouniversenews.wordpress.com/)
