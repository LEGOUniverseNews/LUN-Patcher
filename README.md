# _LEGO Universe News!_ Patcher [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LEGOUniverseNews/LUN-Patcher.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/LEGOUniverseNews/LUN-Patcher) #

This is a "patcher" (actually a news widget) designed for the [_LEGO Universe News!_ Forums](http://legouniversenews.forummotion.com/).
It is designed to imitate one of the later patchers from the now-closed MMOG [LEGO&reg; Universe](http://universe.lego.com/en-us/default.aspx),
and explains why it is called a patcher.

The news widget contains an HTML5 YouTube embed player, links to the LUNF rules, FAQ, Staff Members, and Minifig Wizard pages, in addition to a custom designed news feed from [_LEGO Universe News!_](http://legouniversenews.wordpress.com/).
